# lembas
Customised meal planner web application developed as part of a group project at Imperial College London. It allows users to find and create meal plans that are custom tailored to their nutritional goals and dietary requirements. They can also find recipes and meal plans they like in the shared community. React/Redux was used for the frontend, with nodejs/expressjs for the backend and a postgreSQL database. The Edamam API was used to extract accurate recipes and their associated nutritional data (The API keys have been removed).
